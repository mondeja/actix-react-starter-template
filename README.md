# [ACTIX] ([Rust]) + [React] ([Typescript]) starter template

[Rust] + [Typescript] app starter template with [ACTIX] and [React].

## Basic architecture

- The backend code is located at _./server_ and the frontend at _./client_.
- There is a [POSIX] shell wrapper script to build and run at _./run_, so easy!
- Includes a [pre-commit] configuration for CI checks.

> See _CONTRIBUTING.md_ for how to setup and develop.
