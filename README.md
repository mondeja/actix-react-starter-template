# [ACTIX] ([Rust]) + [React] ([Typescript]) website template

This template offers an ready-to-use [Rust] + [Typescript] website starter
template with [ACTIX] and [React].

## Basic architecture

- The backend code is located at *./server* and the frontend at *./client*.
- There is a [POSIX] shell wrapper script to build and run at *./run*, so easy!
- Includes a [pre-commit] configuration for CI checks.

> See *CONTRIBUTING.md* for how to setup and develop.
