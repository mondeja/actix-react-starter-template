# [ACTIX] (Rust) + [React] (Typescript) website template

This template offers an ready-to-use Rust + Typescript website starter template
with [ACTIX] and [React].

## Understand it

The backend code is located at *./server* and the frontend at *./client*.
There is a [POSIX] shell wrapper script to build and run at *./run*, so easy!
Also, includes [pre-commit] configuration for CI checks.

See *CONTRIBUTING.md* for how to setup and develop.
